# vimrc

Based on .vimrc from example and enhanced with c++ power

PS: true c++ env to code with pleasure wasn't created in Vim. 
The main issue for me was debugging. Even with the latest :TermDebug it wasn't sufficient enough to compensate loss of productivity.
On the other hand, Vim is now my default text editor for everything except c++ coding :D
